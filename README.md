# Open Telekom Cloud Code Community

Community Projects for, with, and by the Open Telekom Cloud. This GitHub space is dedicated to users, developers, engineers, and architects who work with, for, and by the Open Telekom Cloud. This is a self-organized community, which was initiated by the OTC team, but is actually run by volunteers of any affiliations. We share best practices, code modules for Ansible and Terraform, Kubernetes operators, test scripts, and much more. You're welcome to host your own projects here, as long as there's some connection to the OTC platform. Just let us know!

This space is self-managed by individuals. It is not a legally binding offer or service of the Open Telekom Cloud, T-Systems International GmbH, nor Deutsche Telekom AG.

Let us know if you want to host a project! Detailed questions and answers around the Open Telekom Cloud and its services are available at the [Community Portal](https://community.open-telekom-cloud.com).

In-depth official system documentation, best practices, blueprints, and API references are available in the [Helpcenter](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/).
